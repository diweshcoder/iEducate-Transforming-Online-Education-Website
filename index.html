            <p class="sectionSubTag">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
                skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

            <p class="sectionSubTag">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and
                skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and
                through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next.
                As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through
                imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.


                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.

            <p class="sectionSubTag">Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or
                kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most
                regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.

                There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large,
                or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some
                governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development
                Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.
